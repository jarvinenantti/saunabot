# saunabot
Python web bot for automating HOAS sauna-reservations

May serve as a basis for automating other similar reservation systems

1.0: Automate some/all of the reserving process using webbot-library:
https://github.com/nateshmbhat/webbot

2.0: Transfer to Raspberry Pi (change webbot to selenium, and use crontab for timing)
https://www.selenium.dev/
(TODO: 2.1: Use Telegram to communicate with Pi and sauna bot)

TODO: 3.0 Run in AWS

Requires HOAS account. Login info deleted for obvious reasons :)
